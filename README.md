# WebSocket Control Panel
The BubbleJet Team has access to a private control panel that exposes WebSocket management functionality. **This website is private and not intended to be accessed by the public.** The purpose of this repository is to host the https://sockets.bubblejet.app/ website through GitHub Pages. It is in a minified, production-ready state and not intended to be edited by the community.

> We use a modified version of the official [Socket.io Admin UI](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-admin-ui/). You can learn more at their repository.
